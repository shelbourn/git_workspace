  "How do I load a JS file into a browser so I can view the output of the JS code?";

console.log(array[1], question);

const answer = `One of two ways. Either post your code in the index.js file. 
Or create another js file and referrance it in the index.html
<script src="js/bitchFace.js"></script>
*Best idea becuase that is what you'll be doing on the job.*
Or just copy and paste it into your browser console. Browsers can read javascript natively.`;
